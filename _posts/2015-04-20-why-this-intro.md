Italy has a longstanding reputation as a major touristic venue. Estimates of the impact of tourism on national GPD ranges from 10% to 13% depending on the source (e.g. [Rome Business School](https://romebusinessschool.com/blog/the-business-of-tourism-in-italy-analysis-and-outlook-by-sector/)). 
It comes to no surprise that such economic sector had a high consideration among the Italian population and the political class, to the extent that some considered it "Italy's Oil" (source needed).

Since we both grew up in Italy, it was hard not to embrace or at least consider plausible this simplistic view and be personally (and without any sensible reason) proud of the hordes of foreigners coming from far away to see the beaty of the place you live in. 
As the years passed, it became evident to us and to many of our compatriots, that tourism can have side effects as any other economic sector,
This became particularly evident after the COVID pandemics, when for some reasons, the pressure coming from tourism grew quite fast.

At that time, I just moved back to Florence after spending several years in Paris, while Martina was well enstablised in Edimburgh. 
In just a couple of years, we both saw an increasing amount of tourists storming the cities we lived in. 
Rents and house prices raised like never before, quality of life dropped, a weird sense of alienation from the city itself started to spread (maybe more for me in Florence than for Martina in Edimburgh).

Local politics and public opinion started pointing their fingers againts the one they believe is the major contributor to this disater: short term rental - Air bnb. 
The Lonely Planet made an [interesting article](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/florence-overtourism) about overtourism in Florence and short term rental: apparently Florence is among the WorldWide top cities considering the Airbnbâ€™s-per-inhabitant scale, and the third one with most expensive rental prices wrt average income. Maybe all this hatred is not fully immotivated. 

Many cities around the world have, in fact, pushed some limitations to short term rental with the aim of fighting against the widespread presence of Airbnb (ref needed). In 2025 the city of Florence became the first Italian city to apply a [strict regulations](https://www.lodgify.com/blog/it/normativa-affitti-brevi-firenze/) to short term rental, with the hope of making tourism sustainable again.

The Lonely Planet's considerations are based on data from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/), that since many years collect and share Airbnb data to foster reasearch on its effect on local neighborhoods.
Since both Martina and I work as data scientist and are supposed to be trained in data analytics and understanding, we decided to have fun with this data and to see if we can at least monitor what is going on with Airbnb in Italian cities.

Obsviously, we have no claims that what we will do is fully scientific, relevant or solid. We hope that it would be at least interesting and maybe that will help us understand something.
